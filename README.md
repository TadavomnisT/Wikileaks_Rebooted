# Wikileaks Rebooted

![wikileaks_rebooted](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TadavomnisT/Wikileaks_Rebooted/main/Documentation/Images/wikileaks_rebooted.png)

Rebooting Wikileaks: New architecture , new implementation , new technology , to hide data, to hide the identity of whistleblowers!

## Motivation 

It's not over, what Assange started...

The original Wikileaks was shut down due to **Single Point Of Failure** (SPOF)...

Because it needed to rely on a single entity, a single host, a brave man, who was willing to put himself in danger.


It's true, that they have the resources , they can frame anyone standing to shout the truth...

But **we** have imagination!

We can make the tools to take back our sovereignty ( so saild Amir Taaki) .

As `Bitcoin` , `TOR` , `BitTorrent` and etc, proved that our future is decentralized, Decentralization for our systems is a solution for preventing such SPOFs...

**_But will this be enough?_**

That goes to be the central question.

In this repository , the main goal is to achieve such topology of network that'll be safe to say it's secure to **leak** after all.
