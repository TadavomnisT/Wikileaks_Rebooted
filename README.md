# Wikileaks Rebooted

![wikileaks_rebooted](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TadavomnisT/Wikileaks_Rebooted/main/Documentation/Images/wikileaks_rebooted.png)

Rebooting Wikileaks: New architecture , new implementation , new technology , to hide data, to hide the identity of whistleblowers!

## Motivation 


It's not over, what Assange started...

The original Wikileaks was shut down due to **Single Point Of Failure** (SPOF)...

Because it needed to rely on a single entity, a single host, a brave man, who was willing to put himself in danger.


It's true, that they have the resources , they can frame anyone standing to shout the truth...

But **we** have imagination!

We can make the tools to take back our sovereignty ( so said Amir Taaki) .

As `Bitcoin` , `TOR` , `BitTorrent`,.. etc, proved that our future is decentralized, Decentralization for our systems is a solution for preventing such SPOFs...

**_But will this be enough?_**

That is going to be the central question.

In this repository , the main goal is to achieve such topology of the network that it'll be safe to say it's secure for **leaking information** after all.

----------------------------------------

## What are the main issues?

Suppose we come up with an idea which merely solves the SPOF problem, but it brings another problem:
+ How can the system supervise the content?  
+ How can we make sure that observing and directing the execution of the main task is done?  
+ How to be certain about the credibility and authenticity of revealed information?

I will mark this issue as an **open problem** and **help wanted** , and I need your help/ideas in developing this project..
